## Theme

* `twilight.json`
  * Initially generated by Claude based on
    <https://github.com/godfat/dot-rc/blob/e65145370b561eaa1e4fe9b4a67d159a94e413f9/.config/subl/Twilight.tmTheme>
  * Tweaked manually

## Commands

* `command/text-complete.js`
  * Improved and rewritten by Claude guided by me based on
    <https://github.com/getogrand/another-word-completion/commit/691badc8894e821258cfe0bbab1df0aaeb89e5fe>
  * No longer uses any dependencies.
  * No longer pollutes the undo history with cycling by the concept of
    committing when user moves the cursor.
* `command/indent-paste.js`
  * Written by Claude Opus 4 with a lot of back and forth with my tests and
    requests.
  * The main idea is to paste snippets with correct indentation, at the same
    time with a single undo point. Paste on format doesn't work for all
    languages, and it creates 2 undo points.
* `command/string-interpolate.js`
  * Written by Claude Opus 4 with a lot of back and forth with my tests and
    requests.

## Ruby specific settings
