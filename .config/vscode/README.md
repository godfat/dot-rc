## Theme

* `twilight.json`
  * Initially generated by Claude based on
    <https://github.com/godfat/dot-rc/blob/e65145370b561eaa1e4fe9b4a67d159a94e413f9/.config/subl/Twilight.tmTheme>
  * Tweaked manually

## Commands

Mostly written by Claude Opus 4 and guided by me.

* `command/text-complete.js`
  * Text complete by cycling through candidates sorted by line distance
  * One single undo for each completion
  * Commit the completion when the user moves the cursor
* `command/indent-paste.js`
  * The main idea is to paste snippets with correct indentation, at the same
    time with a single undo point. Paste on format doesn't work for all
    languages, and it creates 2 undo points.
* `command/string-interpolate.js`

## Ruby specific settings

* `ruby/configuration.json`
  * Written by Claude Opus 4 with a lot of back and forth with my tests and
    requests.
  * Tweaked manually
* `ruby/snippets.json`
  * Imported from <https://github.com/magicwhite/ruby-snippet/blob/537157ef3a1c5b9c6f74b0e2d4d545371a6d549d/snippets/snippets.json>
  * Tweaked manually

## Other extensions

* Use [Ruby Language Colorization](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=groksrc.ruby) to recognize support (built-in) methods ands keywords.
* Use [NGINX Configuration Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadalli.vscode-nginx-conf) to recognize Nginx config.
