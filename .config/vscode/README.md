# Twilight

Mostly written by Claude Opus 4 and guided by me.

## Theme

* `twilight.json`
  * Initially generated by Claude based on
    <https://github.com/godfat/dot-rc/blob/e65145370b561eaa1e4fe9b4a67d159a94e413f9/.config/subl/Twilight.tmTheme>
  * Tweaked manually

## Text

* `text/text-complete.js`
  * Text complete by cycling through candidates sorted by line distance
  * One single undo for each completion
  * Commit the completion when the user moves the cursor
* `text/indent-paste.js`
  * The main idea is to paste snippets with correct indentation, at the same
    time with a single undo point. Paste on format doesn't work for all
    languages, and it creates 2 undo points

## Ruby

* `ruby/string-interpolate.js`
  * When typing `#` inside a string which can use string interpolation,
    insert snippet `#{}`
  * When typing `#` with a selection, wrap it with `#{}`
* `ruby/configuration.json`
* `ruby/snippets.json`

## Other extensions

* Use [erb](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CraigMaslowski.erb) to recognize ERB.
* Use [NGINX Configuration Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadalli.vscode-nginx-conf) to recognize Nginx config.
